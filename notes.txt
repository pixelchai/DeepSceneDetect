time taken to join two clips using CrossFadeJoiner = 80.67, 74.97
time taken for those same two clips using ConcatJoiner = 0.61

two different clips:
CrossFadeJoiner = 60.76, 48.10, 46.27, 43.17, 42.29
ConcatJoiner = 0.19, 0.18, 0.19

note: found moviepy to be too slow
note: also ffmpeg-concat was a bit dodgy, see: https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/ffmpeg-concat/issues/72
                                          also this problem: https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/ffmpeg-concat/issues/8
note: also editly seems promising but early in development + dodgy, see: https://github.com/mifi/editly/issues/14
note: ffmpeg gl transitions: failed to compile for me (https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/ffmpeg-gl-transition)

Keep getting this when trying to use CrossFadeJoiner:
[mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2 @ 0x55d9cbd1f340] moov atom not found
data/out/out_tmp.mp4: Invalid data found when processing input

using mkv instead didn't help:
[matroska,webm @ 0x562c18989340] EBML header parsing failed
data/out/out_tmp.mkv: Invalid data found when processing input

fixed by actually reencoding stuff ^
